There are some state machines in the design of DDS and RTPS. This can be done using hard code logic or 
using a library. 
I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5923767/simple-state-machine-example-in-c
that can help. I liked the idea of using  http://code.google.com/p/bbvcommon/wiki/StateMachine.

In order to implement the query language of DDS, I found nice the idea of applying 
Expression Tress at  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6488034/how-to-implement-a-rule-engine
and http://coding-time.blogspot.com.es/2011/07/how-to-implement-rule-engine-in-c.html

TODO. Review this code and apply if appropiate.
